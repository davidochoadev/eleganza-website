Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify**: If requirements are vague, ask up to 3 pointed questions (target audience, stack, constraints, brand/tone). If requirements are clear, proceed without blocking.
2. **Commit to a Direction**: Choose a bold, coherent aesthetic and state it in 1–2 sentences before coding.
3. **Implement**: Build working code that matches the direction, follows the project stack, and is responsive.
4. **Polish**: Tighten spacing, typography, and interaction states; remove redundancy.
5. **Deliver**: Provide the code plus a short rationale, and note any optional enhancements.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **bold aesthetic direction**:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility, existing design system.
- **Differentiation**: Define the one memorable signature (shape, type, layout, motion, texture).

**Critical**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision. Intentionality matters more than intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Distinctive display font + refined body font. Avoid default stacks and overused web fonts.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive palette. Use CSS variables for consistency. Prefer dominant colors + sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Fewer, higher-impact moments. Use a staggered page-load reveal and one signature interaction. Prefer CSS-only for static HTML; use Motion libraries in React when available.
- **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry, overlap, and intentional negative space. Break the grid when it serves the concept.
- **Backgrounds & Detail**: Add atmosphere via gradients, textures, subtle noise, geometric motifs, and layered shadows.

Never use generic AI aesthetics: predictable layouts, template-like sections, purple gradients on white, or overused font stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts).

Vary between light/dark themes, typography families, and visual language across tasks.

**Important**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic. Maximalist designs need richer code and effects; minimalist designs need precision and restraint.

## Production Standards

- Ensure mobile and desktop layout integrity.
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy and readable contrast.
- Include focus/hover/active states on interactive elements.
- Avoid inline styles unless the project style requires them.

Remember: aim for unforgettable, intentional design—not safe averages.
